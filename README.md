# hubitat-zwavemultichannel-pe653
Development of a Hubitat DTH (Device Type Handler) for the Intermatic PE953 Z-Wave Pool Controller

The original author was @BigPunk6 who created the first working PE653 driver for SmartThings.
The driver was substantially rewritten and enhanced by @KeithR26 (Keith Riley) who is the primary maintainer.
Significant contributions by @tooluser, Joshua Marker.
